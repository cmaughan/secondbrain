# Arithmetic

## Commutative 
**Addition + Multiplication**
$$ 5 + 6 = 6 + 5 $$
$$ 5 * 6 = 6 * 5 $$
  
## Associative 
**Addition + Multiplication**
$$ 3 + (4 + 5) = (3 + 4) + 5 $$

## Distributive
**Mult, Left to Right**
$$ 3 * (4 + 5) = (3 * 4) + (3 * 5) $$
$$ 3 * (4 - 5) = (3 * 4) - (3 * 5) $$
**Divide, Right to Left**
$$ (4 + 5) / 3 = (4 / 3) + (5 / 3) $$
NOTE: 
$$ 3 / (4 +5) != (3 / 4) + (3 / 5) $$

## Factors
Any pair of whole numbers are factors of their product.
$$ 3 * 6 = 18 $$
3 and 6 are factors.
For 18, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 9, 6, 18, because:
$$ 1 * 18 = 18 $$
$$ 2 * 9 = 18 $$
$$ 3 * 6 = 18 $$

## Primes
Two factors, one of which is 1, and the number.  That's a prime
Every whole number can be written as a product of prime factors.

## Prime Factorization
Divide by increasingly large numbers
$$ 126: $$
$$ 126 / 2 = 63 $$
$$ 63 / 3 = 21 $$
$$ 21 / 3 = 7 $$
$$ 7 / 7 = 1  $$
$$ = 2 * 2 * 3 * 7 $$

## Highest Common Factor
Find the highest number that divides into both numbers
Lay out the prime factorization:
$$ 144 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 $$
$$ 66 = 2             * 3      * 11 $$
$$ HCF = 2 * 3 = 6 $$
Multiply together _all_ common prime factors

> NOTE: Possible to have a single common factor; try 34 & 92

<div id="lcm"/> 

## Lowest Common Multiple
Find the lowest number the numbers divide into 
From above, use all factors from both numbers
[Good diagram here](https://www.cimt.org.uk/projects/mepres/book8/bk8i2/bk8_2i4.htm)

$$ LCM = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 11 = 1584 $$
Check:
$$ 1584 / 144 = 11 $$
$$ 1584 / 66 = 24 $$

## Fractions
$$ 1 \frac{1}{4} $$
This fraction is in its **lowest terms** because common factors include just unity
Ratios occur in fractions with equal denominators.  A **percentage** has 100 as denominator
Multiply a fraction by 100 to turn it into a percentage
$$ \frac{1}{4} * 100 = 25\% $$

## 28. Division of Integers
- Proper fraction; numerator less than denominator (1 /4)
- Improper; top heavy
- Mixed: 
$$ 1  \frac{1}{4} $$

### Multiplying Fractions
$$ \frac{2}{4} * \frac{3}{8} = \frac{2 * 3}{4 * 8} = \frac{6}{32} $$

## 34. Equivalent Fractions
Multiply top and bottom by the same number, get the same
$$ \frac{4}{5} \equiv \frac{12}{15}$$
Reverse the process; divide top and bottom by the same to reduce the fraction to **lowest terms**

## 37. Dividing Fractions
Flip the divider, multiply instead.
$$ \frac{2}{4} \div \frac{3}{8} \equiv \frac{2}{4} * \frac{8}{3} $$

## 41. Adding Fractions
Find common denominator, using [LCM](#lcm), or just by figuring out a low number.  Then can add
$$ \frac{2}{4} - \frac{3}{8} \equiv \frac{4}{8} - \frac{3}{8} \equiv \frac{1}{8} $$

## 58. Significant Figures
0.1345 to 2 Significant figures = 0.13
1355 to 2 Significant figures = 1400

## 61. Decimal Places
0.0035 to 2 decimal places = 0.0035
0.2356 to 2 decimal places = 0.24A

### Decimals as Fractions
$$ 1.224 =  \frac{1224}{1000} \equiv \frac{153}{125} $$

## 70. Unending decimals
Put a dot over first and last number that repeats
$$ 0.183183 \equiv 0.\dot{1}8\dot{3} $$
Any unnending repeating form can be a fraction.
Convert to a fraction:
$$ 1000x = 183.\dot{1}8\dot{3} $$
$$ x = 0.\dot{1}8\dot{3} $$
$$ 1000x - x = 183.\dot{1}8\dot{3} - 0.\dot{1}8\dot{3} $$
$$ 999x = 183 $$
$$ x = 183 / 999 $$
