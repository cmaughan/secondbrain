## Commutative 
**Addition + Multiplication**
$$
5 + 6 = 6 + 5  \\
5 * 6 = 6 * 5
$$
  
## Associative 
**Addition + Multiplication**
$$
3 + (4 + 5) = (3 + 4) + 5
$$

## Distributive
**Mult, Left to Right**
$$ 
3 * (4 + 5) = (3 * 4) + (3 * 5) \\
3 * (4 - 5) = (3 * 4) - (3 * 5)
$$
**Divide, Right to Left**
$$
(4 + 5) / 3 = (4 / 3) + (5 / 3) \\
NOTE:\\
 3 / (4 +5) != (3 / 4) + (3 / 5)
$$

## Factors
Any pair of whole numbers are factors of their product.
$$ 3 * 6 = 18 $$
3 and 6 are factors.
For 18, the factors are 1, 2, 3, 9, 6, 18, because:
$$
1 * 18 = 18 \\
2 * 9 = 18
3 * 6 = 18
$$

### Primes
Two factors, one of which is 1, and the number.  That's a prime
Every whole number can be written as a product of prime factors.

**Prime Factorization**
Divide by increasingly large numbers
$$
126:\\
126 / 2 = 63 \\
63 / 3 = 21 \\
21 / 3 = 7 \\
7 / 7 = 1  \\
= 2 * 2 * 3 * 7
$$

**Highest Common Factor**
Lay out the prime factorization:
$$
 144 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 \\
 66 = 2             * 3      * 11 \\
 HCF = 2 * 3 = 6
$$
> NOTE: Possible to have a single common factor; try 34 & 92

**Lowest Common Multiple**
Find the lowest number the numbers divide into 
From above, use all factors from both numbers
$$
LCM = 2 * 2 * 2 * 2 * 3 * 3 * 11 = 1584 \\
Check: \\
1584 / 144 = 11 
1584 / 66 = 24
$$

# Fractions
# 28. Division of Integers
- Proper fraction; numerator less than denominator (1 /4)
- Improper; top heavy
- Mixed: 
$$ 1  \frac{1}{4} $$

**Multiplying Fractions**
$$ \frac{2}{4} * \frac{3}{8} = \frac{2 * 3}{4 * 8} = \frac{6}{32} $$

**Equivalent Fractions**

Multiply top and bottom by the same number, get the same
$$ \frac{4}{5} \equiv \frac{12}{15}$$
Reverse the process; divide top and bottom by th same to reduce the fraction to **lowest terms**
