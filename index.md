# Chris Maughan's Second Brain

This is my digital garden, wiki, second brain.  Pick your favourite modern phrase to describe it.  A place where I post blog entries, useful links and other articles.  It is more for me than for you, but you may find interesting things among the links and articles.
This whole thing is just a bunch of markdown text, converted to a website by Neuron, a static website generator.  There's a small sprinkling of javascript for the subscription links and styling, but that's about it.  In this way, I can edit this website using Vim on my local machine and push it to github whenver I like.  A github action builds the site automatically.
