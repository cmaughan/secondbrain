# Spectroscopy

## Atoms

Nucleus 99.8% of the mass $10^{-14}m$, with total diameter $10^{-10}m$ including electron orbits.
Protons and Neutrons held together by _strong nuclear force_.  They have mass about $1.7*10^{-27}kg$ - about 2000 times the mass of an electron (about $9.1*10^{-31}kg$)

Hydrogen spectrum lines between 656.3nm and 364.6nm.  Spectral lines named as greeks: 1st line is $H\alpha$, $H\beta$, $H\gamma$.  This is the _Balmer Series_ of lines.

Note the emission line at the red end, accounting for redness in Nebula.

Rydberg Constant
$$ R = 1.097*10^{7}m^{-1} $$

Balmer's formula (wavelength of spectral lines)
$$ \frac{1}{\lambda} = R(\frac{1}{4} - \frac{1}{n^2}) $$
