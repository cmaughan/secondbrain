# Star Radiation

Temperature of a substance is related to thermal energy.

**Farenheit** temperature scale.  Originally 100&deg; was the temperature of a human body. 32&deg;F is freezing.  Boiling is 212&deg;

**Celcius** scale. 0&deg;C freezing, 100&deg;C boiling

**Kelvin** 0K absolute zero (no energy). 273.16K ; 0.01K above the melting point of ice.  Triple point of water.  Water boils at 373.15K, Ice melts at 273.15K.  Earth is 300K, Sun is 5800K, Center of Sun is 15,000,000K

## Hot Matter Radiation
Temperature and color of light emitted is related.  Hot matter radiates heat and light.

## Light
Light is an electromagnetic wave

$$ c = \lambda f \tag{Eq 3.1}$$
&lambda; = wavelength \
f = frequency \
c = speed of light $(3.0 * 10^8 ms^{-1})$

Light propogates as photons 'wave packets'.  Light is quantized.

## Planck's Law of Quantisation

Energy in a photon, proportional to the frequency
$$ E=hf \tag{Eq 3.2} $$
Planck's constant h is $6.6*10^{-34}$ J s (Planck's law of quantisation)

Substituing 3.1:
$$ E=\frac{hc}{\lambda} \tag{Eq 3.3}$$

## Kinetic Energy

Average thermal energy of a particle:
$$ E_{thermal} = \frac{1}{2}mv^2 = \frac{3}{2}kT \tag{Eq. 3.4}$$

k is Bolzmann constant \
T is temperature

## Black Body Radiation

A black body is a perfect emitter and absorber of radiation.
