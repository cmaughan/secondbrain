# The Earth

- An **Oblate Spheroid**
- 12,724km **Diameter** (~13Km)
- **Equatorial** diameter is 42km greater than the **polar**
- Inclined 23.44&deg; (~23.5) 
    - Precession; wobble of the axial tilt; 25800 year cycle
    - **axial tilt** or **obliquity**  deviation from the parallel
- **Celestial equator** - abstract projection of the terrestrial equator into space, and is the base of the equatorial coordinate system.  
- **Ecliptic** - the plane of earth's orbit around the sun
- **South Celestial Pole** - the point in the sky about which all the stars seen from the Southern Hemisphere rotate
- **North Celestial Pole** - the point in the sky about which all the stars seen from the Northern Hemisphere rotate

- **Crust** varies between 0-70km.  Continental crust of low density rocks like granite.  Thinner oceanic crust of denser rock like basalt

- **Tectonic** platest floating on a silicate mantle
- **Mantle** extends half way to the center, making up **80%** of the volume.  Lower mantle is solid, upper mantle convection currents which drive sideways movements of tectonic plates.
- **Outer Core** 5000K, liquid Iron **Fe**, Some Nickel **Ni**
- **Inner Core** 5500K, Same temp as sun's photosphere, high pressure, solid.  **Ni**, **Fe**

## Latitude and Longitude

Lat/Long are angles **subtended** (joined at point) at the center of the earth.  Lat is E/W of Meridian, and N/S of equator

- **Prime Meridian** passes through Greenwich, between N & S pole (agreed in 1884 in Washington DC)
- **Artic Circle** 66&deg;34' N (66.5&deg;N)
- **Tropic of Cancer** 23&deg;26' N
- **Tropic of Capricorn** 23&deg;26' S
- **Antarctic Circle** 66&deg;34' S (66.5&deg;S)
- **Spring Equinox** March 21st - Sun over the equator
- **Summer Solstice** June 21st - Sun over Tropic of Cancer **23.5&deg;N**
- **Autumnal Equinox** September 23rd - Sun over the equator
- **Winter Solstice** December 21st - Sun over Tropic of Capricorn **23.5&deg;S**

**Arctic** and **Antarctic** circles are the furthest point where you can still see the sun set every day of the year.

## Atmosphere

Absorbs harmful radiation, UV and X-radiation, regulates temperature to mean 15&deg; and protects from most meteoroid strikes

Blue sky because Nitrogen(N) and Oxygen(O2) scatter blue wavelengths of light, mostly.  So the sky is predominantly blue.
Air is always in turbulent motion, causing light to refract and change direction as it passes through the different layers.  Causes stars to 'twinkle'

Light pollution - **Skyglow** - a rusty orange haze by urban lighting.
**Glare** from artificial lights such as streetlights, carparks, etc, making night vision harder **dark adaption**
200 stars in light polluted areas are visible, but 3000 where there is no light pollution
Light pollution makes the sky brighter than the natural night sky, making it hard to observe faint objects such as galaxies or nebulas.  

> ```(Light pollution) makes the sky brighter/reduces contrast (1) so fainter stars (in the constellation) are not seen (1)```
 
> ```{Dark adjustment/adaption of human eye/the aperture of the eye is larger} (1) which {allows more light in/makes the eye more sensitive to light} from faint stars (1)```

#TBD
- Visit to Greenwich?
- More info on Lat/Long
- More on the earth's crust/composition
