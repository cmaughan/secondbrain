# Stellar Structure

The internal structure of stars.

## Equations of Stellar Structure

Mass of a shell inside the star:
$$ m = \rho(r) * 4 \Pi r^2 \Delta r \tag{Eq 8.1} $$

For real stars, density peaks in the center.  But we can approximate.  Density of the Sun:

i.e. Density is Mass / Volume

$$ \bar{\rho} = \frac{M_\odot}{\frac{4 \Pi R_\odot^3}{3}} = 1400 {kg} m^{-3} $$

Density of water is $1000 kg m^-3$

Mean density of terrestrial planets is $5000 kg m^{-3}$

Central density of sun is $1.6*10^5 kg m^{-3}$

## Hydrostatic Equilibrium

Stars are mostly in equilibrium.  They are held together by:

1. Self gravity.  Inward force, eventual cause of collapse, other forces work against it.
2. Pressure Forces due to hot gas.
3. Rotating stars bulge around the equator, outward fictitious force.
4. Magnetic field, which also helps to stop collapse inwards.
